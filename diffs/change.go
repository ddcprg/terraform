	// For Create, New is the value that will be created and Old is a null
	// value of the same type.

	// For Read, New describes the object that will be read. A New value
	// for Read will generally consist primarily of unknown values, thus
	// indicating the expected structure of the result even though the values
	// are not yet known. Old may either be null, indicating that the value
	// is being read for the first time, or may be a prior value that the
	// read value will replace.
	//
	// For Update and Replace, Old describes the expected existing value to
	// update and New is its replacement. For Replace, ForceNew is also
	// populated.
	//
	// For Delete, Old is the expected value to destroy and New must be a null
	// value of the change type.

	// New value may contain unknowns, however.
